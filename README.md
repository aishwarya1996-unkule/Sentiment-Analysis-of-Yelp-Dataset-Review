## Details
For this project, we investigated running sentiment analysis on topics extracted from review text in order to determine what aspects of businesses are important to customers. The topics for each review were generated from high scoring term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) keywords, then used as features for a classification model which would try to predict whether a review was ‘extreme’ or ‘neutral’.
